        <h1>C Language for Science and Engineering</h1>
        <h2>Why every student should learn C language?</h2>
        <hr class="my-3">
        <a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg shadow-none change" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseExample"
          role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">Find out</a>

      <div class="collapse" id="collapseExample">
        <div class="card card-body">
          <p>
            Before we begin, let me defend the somewhat outrageous title of this article with an analogy: You can make
            your own bread with a prepackaged mix, a bread machine and some electricity—or, you can assemble the raw
            ingredients, a mixing bowl, a stout spoon, a dough blade, fire up the oven and get some cardio through
            kneading. If it’s just fresh bread you’re after, the machine gets you there.
            <br>
            But if you want to understand the underlying process and have the most options when it comes to the final
            product, you need to put in the effort of the manual method. This is a lot like tackling the C programming
            language: You have to dig down into the flour and get your hands dusty, but you end up understanding the
            process at an intimate level.
            <br>
            First, let’s make a distinction between someone who wants to just learn any programming language (the guy
            who just wants the bread) from someone who has the desire to be a polyglot programmer (the artisan baker).
            Don't get me wrong, there are many great reasons to learn a programming language, and even if you just learn
            one higher level scripting language like Python or JavaScript, you’re still a programmer. Mastering any
            single language is still a challenge and a worthy goal.
            <br>
            However, the programmer I’m addressing here is someone who wants to understand programming at a deeper level
            just for programming’s sake. This is someone who naturally has a desire to become that polyglot programmer.
            <br>
            Originally, I wanted to title this article “Why Every Programmer Should Learn C First,” but I backed away
            from that. Sure, there are advantages to learning C first; you won’t get seduced by a language like Python
            and never come back. In fact, if I were teaching high school students, I would almost certainly teach them a
            higher level language like Python first. Then I would take my best students and teach them C second. If I
            were teaching a class of science and engineers, I would probably just start with C. Let’s face it, if they
            learned Maxwell’s equations, a little pointer indirection isn’t going to induce a lot of angst.
          </p>
          <br>
          <div class="advantages">
            <h4>
              Advantages
            </h4>
            <p>
              However, I do think there are advantages to learning C first over C++ or Java. When you work in languages
              like Java, C# and even Python, you immediately start moving away from learning the fundamentals of a
              programming language and you start learning associated libraries and frameworks. But with C you get a few
              library calls, you stay focused on the semantics of the language longer, and C often forces you to think
              harder and deeper about what’s happening under the hood.
              <br>
              C is a middle level language. When people talk about it you’ll hear phrases like “coding to the metal,” or
              “coding close to the wire”. C is the language of compilers, interpreters, editors, operating systems and
              embedded programming When you learn to program in C you almost have to gain an understanding of how
              programs execute. You know what things like register, stack, heap and memory mapped IO mean. You start to
              think how much better life would have been if you had been born with sixteen fingers.
              <br>
            </p>
            <h4>
              Simplicity and Speed
            </h4>
            <p>
              C is simple, elegant and wicked fast; it’s compact and efficient. Because C has raw pointers, bitwise
              operators, and the keywords: extern, volatile, static, and register—meaning you’ll understand more about
              writing efficient code than you can glean from any higher-level language. The only thing that will teach
              you these things any better is a low-level language, and with modern processors I wouldn’t wish assembler
              on anyone.
              <br>
              The C syntax is why programmers talk about the “C Family of Languages,” which generally includes languages
              like: C, C++, C#, Java, EcmaScript (aka JavaScript), Objective-C and many others. Wikipedia lists plenty
              more, but I think their list is a bit wacky.
              <br>
            </p>
            <h4>
              Discipline
            </h4>
            <p>
              C also happens to be demanding, fastidious, finicky and sometimes downright cryptic. You can easily write
              hard-to-read, difficult to maintain code in C. But and this is a key point, you don’t have to Learning to
              write maintainable code in C will require (and hopefully instill) coding discipline. In most languages
              fixing syntax errors can border on the trivial For instance, Ada’s compiler error messages are so good it
              might as well have just fixed the code for you. Finding and correcting a missing or additional semicolon
              in C can sometimes be an epic undertaking.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Fewer Distractions
            </h4>
            <p>
              C is not an object-oriented language, so you don’t get distracted by things like inheritance and
              polymorphism. I’m not saying these aren’t important concepts, it’s just that you can simplify things a bit
              by learning straight procedural programming first. In fact, once you've learned C, and written a couple of
              embedded programs on some single board computers, learning C++ is a natural next step. You will need to
              get someone to pry your fingers off the macros and preprocessor directives but other than that it will be
              straightforward. I would be tempted to teach C with a C++ compiler, and just highlight the few differences
              that weren’t backwards compatible with a strict C compiler.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Embedded Programming
            </h4>
            <p>
              My final argument for learning C is tied to doing embedded programming. As a programmer, I always get a
              sense of satisfaction when I deliver any working piece of code. Making a computer do what you want can be
              satisfying. But when I integrate my embedded code with some custom hardware that makes things happen
              outside of the computer—from moving a robotic arm to generating a precisely timed waveform—I get an
              incomparable thrill. That thrill only happens because I learned C Of course, I ended up doing most of my
              embedded coding in C++ but I still felt that learning C first made it all possible. If you want a fast
              pleasant way to learn C, Sigma-PI Academy has you covered, check out my Course on The C Programming
              Language in Action.

        <div class="card card-body">
          <p>C++ is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that was designed by Bjarne Stroustrup in to
            be an extension of the C language It has the features of imperative, object-oriented as well as generic
            programming models C++ also has some additional facilities to those in C such as classes, inheritance,
            default function argument, etc
            C++ plays quite an integral role in modern times as many contemporary systems such as operating systems, web
            browsers, databases, etc have C++ code in at least some part of their codebase Moreover, C++ is quite useful
            in performance critical areas because of its speed
            Keeping the popularity and relevance of C++ in mind, the top reasons to learn it are given below:
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>C++ Popularity and High Salary</h4>
          <p>C++ is one of the most popular languages in the world It is used by some million developers worldwide Also,
            C++ Developers are quite sought after and they hold some of the most high-paying jobs in the industry with
            an average base pay of $ , per year.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>C++ has Abundant Library Support</h4>
          <p>C++ has the Standard Template Library(STL) that is very useful as it helps in writing code compactly and
            quickly as required It contains mainly four components i e algorithms, containers, functions, and iterators
            The algorithms are of different types such as sorting, searching, etc The containers store classes to
            implement different data structures that are commonly used such as stacks, queues, hash tables, vectors,
            sets, lists, maps, etc
            The functors allow the working of the associated function to be customized with the help of the parameters
            passed Also, the iterators are used for working upon a sequence of values.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>C++ has a Large Community</h4>
          <p>There is a large online community of C++ users and experts that is particularly helpful in case any support
            is required. There is a lot of resources like GeeksforGeeks etc available on the internet regarding C++.
            Some
            of the other online resources for C++ include StackOverflow, cppreference com, Standard C++, etc.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>C++ In Databases</h4>
          <p>There are many modern-day databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, MemSQL, etc that are written in C++. This is
            because C++ is quite modern and it supports features like exceptions, lambda expressions, etc. Many of the
            databases that are written in C++ are used in almost all of the in-use applications such as YouTube,
            WordPress, Twitter, Facebook, etc.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>C++ In Operating Systems</h4>
          <p>All the major operating systems such as Windows, Linux, Android, Ubuntu, iOS, etc are written in a
            combination of C and C++. The Windows applications are written in C++, while Android applications are
            written in Java along with C/C++ with non-default run-times for C++ support. Also, C++ can be used to
            develop the core of the applications in iOS .In general, C or C++ are used in operating systems because of
            the speed and strongly typed nature of these languages.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>C++ In Compilers</h4>
          <p>C++ is closer to the hardware level and is a comparatively low-level language. Because of this reason, it
            is used in many compilers as a backend programming language. An example of this is the GNU Compiler
            Collection (GCC) which is currently written mostly in C++ along with C.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>C++ In Web Browsers</h4>
          <p>A lot of web browsers are developed using C++ such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc Chrome contains C++ in
            the rendering engine, JavaScript engine, and the UI Firefox uses mainly in the rendering engine and a little
            in the UI Safari also uses C++ in the rendering engine and JavaScript engine
            All these web browsers and more use C++, particularly in the rendering engines because it provides the
            required speed that is necessary for the rendering engines since they need to display the content at an
            accelerated rate.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>C++ In Graphics</h4>
          <p>Applications requiring graphics such as digital image processing, computer vision, screen recording
            programs, etc use C++ due to its high speed. This can also include different games that have graphics as a
            big part of their structure .
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>C++ In Embedded Systems</h4>
          <p>C++ is closer to the hardware level and so it is quite useful in embedded systems as the software and
            hardware in these are closely coupled. There are many embedded systems that use C++ such as smart watches,
            MP players, GPS systems, etc .
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>C++ is Portable</h4>
          <p>Programs developed in C++ can be moved from one platform to another. This is one of the main reasons that
            applications requiring multi-platform or multi-device development often use C++ .
          </p>

          <h4>Java’s Popularity and High Salary : </h4>
          <p>Java is one of the most popular languages in the world. It is used by some million developers and it runs
            on
            around billion devices worldwide according to Oracle blogs. Because of the high demand for Java, Java
            developers are also quite sought after and they hold some of the most high-paying jobs in the industry.</p>
          <h4>Java has an abundant API : </h4>
          <p>Java has an abundant Application Programming Interface (API) that includes many Java classes, packages,
            interfaces, etc This is useful for constructing applications without necessarily knowing their inside
            implementations
            Java has mainly three types of API i e Official Java core API’s, Optional official Java API’s and Unofficial
            API’s These API’s overall are used for almost everything including networking, I/O, databases, media, XML
            parsing, speech synthesis, etc
            .</p>
          <h4>Java has multiple Open Source Libraries : </h4>
          <p>Open source libraries have resources that can be copied, studied, changed, shared, etc There are multiple
            open source libraries in Java such as JHipster, Maven, Google Guava, Apache Commons, etc that can be used to
            make Java development easier, cheaper and faster.</p>
          <h4>
            Java has Powerful Development Tools : </h4>
          <p>There are many Integrated development environments (IDE’s) in Java that provides various facilities for
            software development to programmers Powerful Java IDE’s such as Eclipse, NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA, etc play a
            big role in the success of Java
            These IDE’s provide many facilities such as debugging, syntax highlighting, code completion, language
            support, automated refactoring, etc that make coding in Java easier and faster
            Java has created a base for the Android operating system and opted around fortune companies for develop a
            lot of back-end applications Also, it plays a great role in Apache Hadoop data processing, Amazon Web
            Services, and Windows Azure, etc
            .</p>
          <h4>
            Java is Free of Cost :
          </h4>
          <p>One of the reasons Java is very popular among individual programmers is that it is available under the
            Oracle Binary Code License (BCL) free of charge. This means that Java is free for development and test
            environments, but for commercial purposes, a small fee is required.</p>
          <h4>Java is Platform Independent : </h4>
          <p>Java is platform independent as the Java source code is converted to byte code by the compiler which can
            then be executed on any platform using the Java Virtual Machine Java is also known as a WORA (write once,
            run anywhere) language because it is platform independent.
            Also, the development of most Java applications occurs in a Windows environment while they are run on a UNIX
            platform because of the platform independent nature of Java
            .</p>
          <h4>Java has great Documentation Support : </h4>
          <p>The documentation support for Java is excellent using Javadoc which is the documentation generator for Java
            It uses the Java source code to generate the API documentation in HTML format So, Javadoc provides a great
            reference while coding in Java so that understanding the code is quite simple.</p>
          <h4>Java is Versatile : </h4>
          <p>Java is very versatile as it is used for programming applications on the web, mobile, desktop, etc using
            different platforms Also, Java has many features such as dynamic coding, multiple security features,
            platform-independent characteristics, network-centric designing, etc that make it quite versatile.</p>

        <h2>Why every programmer should have strong grasp on Data Structures and Algorithms?</h2>
        <hr class="my-3">
        <a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg shadow-none change" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseExample6"

      </div>
      <div class="collapse" id="collapseExample6">
        <div class="card card-body">
          <p>Imagine that you want to make an app which searches in a specific city for the shortest road to reach a
            specific destination case you are late, note that here you are late, which means you can’t wait, simply the
            answer for that problem is that, try every road and minimize the length, finally tell the user the path with
            the minimum path, which will take a lot and a lot of time, and you can’t wait, so you need a specific method
            or “algorithm” to do this fast.
            This is a simple example, a lot of other problems may take hours or days to be solved with the native
            solution, it also may take years! can you imagine?
            The same thing with algorithms, some ways to store data makes it easy to be manipulated easier and faster
            which is what you want, for example assume that you have a system which generates generous values to your
            ratio of sugar in your blood, it takes a record for every second, and warns you with the lowest value, you
            can implement it using vector, and every once you add a record, you go calculate the minimum, that takes a
            lot of time, on that other hand you can use priority queue which keeps the lowest value itself.
          </p>
          <h5>1. To not be constrained by the programming language for data-structure : </h5>
          <p>Without a good knowledge of various data structures, it is easy to be constrained to thinking for solutions
            in terms of the data structures directly provided by the language
            If you were a Java programmer, you’d probably be thinking on solutions just in terms of what is provided in
            java lang util package
            Well, there’s lots more Take for instance a simple need: In a low end, basic phone, as the user types
            something, you’d like to present the user with “auto complete” feature Thinking in terms of the data
            structures readily provided by the language /libraries doesn’t help much.
          </p>
          <h5>2. Better hardware is not a solution : </h5>
          <p>No amount of additional hardware is going to compensate for an inefficient algorithm Super computer takes
            week to sort a billion numbers using insertion sort whereas a home computer takes minutes sort a billion
            numbers using <b>merge sort</b>.
            <br>
            <i> Insertion Sort: O(n*n)</i>
            <br>
            <i>Merge Sort: O(n log n)</i>
          </p>
          <h5>3. You’ll come across some very interesting, non-intuitive ways of solving problems : </h5>
          <p>Given an array with n distinct elements and n copies of another element. Find the missing element : Well,
            the normal solution we would all think of is to do a linear scan through the array and to find the missing
            element after reading through n/ + elements at the worst case [ Worst case = all n/ distinct numbers appear
            first in the array and then the number-which-repeats appears n/ times]
            Interestingly, this could be solved faster this way :
            <br><i> while(true) do</i>
            <br><i> i = Rand numberWithinRange(to n)</i>
            <br><i> j = Rand numberWithinRange(to n)</i>
            <br><i> if(i!=j) and a[i]=a[j] then return i;</i>
            <br>And the probability that the algorithm does not quit in iterations is !
            “Randomization” turns out to be an amazing practical way of solving some section of problems
            And to give a more “real-world’s application for “randomization” -The randomized version of quicksort is one
            of the most practical/ efficient sorting algorithms !
            Get ready to be surprised by lots of cool, non-intuitive-yet-amazing ways of solving problems.
          </p>
          <h5>4. Refresh a little bit on probability, logarithm and some fun math : </h5>
          <p>It’s interesting to get back to some math, – specifically on probability, expectations, logarithm.
          </p>
          <h5>5. Learn some interesting design paradigms : </h5>
          <p>While learning different algorithms, you’d also be grasping the different algorithm design paradigms
            (Divide and Conquer, Greedy method, Backtracking, Dynamic Programming)
            When there’s a new problem to be solved, this knowledge helps to come up with an efficient solution.
          </p>
          <h5>6. It’s a skill : </h5>
          <p>Certain things are just “knowledge” – that could be learned-along-the-way when a need arises
            For example: There’s not really a need to know all the “MVC” frameworks out there Knowing one is just enough
            There’s a need to use some other MVC framework ? Well that could be learned along the way
            But algorithms and data structures don’t fall into that category It’s a skill, to deduce an algorithm for a
            problem / It’s a skill to analyse the complexity and tell which algorithm is the better one / It’s good to
            learn in advance Acquiring a skill is interesting, right?
          </p>
          <h5>7. Quadratic complexity when O(n) solution exists : </h5>
          <p>Without some learning of algorithms, it’s quite possible that we come up with inefficient solutions when an
            efficient one already exists!
          </p>
          <h5>8. Understanding what’s behind the everyday tools : </h5>
          <p>Almost every tool that we use, day after day, applies some cool algorithms.
          </p>
